# freertos_openthread
Openthread subscriber running on freertos (not working) 

mqttsn_client_subscriber file is a modified example from the SDK, removing button input etc. to connect, connecting automatically to the mqtt broker and subscribing to topic.

freertos_coap_server file is an attempt to implement the code from mqttsn_client_subscriber in freertos. Currently not working.
